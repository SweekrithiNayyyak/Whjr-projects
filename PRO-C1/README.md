As a mayor of the city, you need to create sufficient housing to have no homeless people in
your city. You have a fixed amount of space to build housing and buildings for every family
in the city.
360 families live in the city. Each Floor can house 2 families in two adjacent apartments.
Hence, a building of 12 floors will house 24 families. You have space to create only 10
buildings.
Your task is to create an arrangement of buildings in the city. You can control how high a
building can be by assigning the floors to a building.
