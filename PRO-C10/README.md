Jaxon visited his best friend's home. He loved the Running Surfers game that his friend was
playing on his mobile phone. When he returned home, he tried to play the same game on his
mobile phone, but unfortunately his mobile phone does not support the game. So he decided
to build a computer game which would be similar to the actual Running Surfers game.
Can you help Jaxon design the game?
