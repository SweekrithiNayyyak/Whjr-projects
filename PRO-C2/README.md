One of the factions on Planet Herosa, the Squarian people, really liked your work. Lord
Squarier, the faction leader, has entrusted you to create a game for the Squarian people.
His instructions are very clear:
● Have a square game board or table.
● There should be square pieces which can be moved around.
● The primary piece in the game should be white.
● All other pieces should be dark gray.
